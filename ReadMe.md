## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Problems

On macOS Sonoma, some text may be printed on the terminal like:
```
2025-01-28 23:39:24.855 java[2091:30776] +[IMKClient subclass]: chose IMKClient_Modern
2025-01-28 23:39:24.855 java[2091:30776] +[IMKInputSession subclass]: chose IMKInputSession_Modern
```

As a workaround:
- On Mac systems, ReKot occasionally fully refreshes the screen at some interval.
- You can press `Ctrl+R` to manually refresh the screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building/Developing ReKot

Currently, ReKot depends on the [Kotlin Analysis API](https://kotlin.github.io/analysis-api) with a few patches on top. These patches are in my fork of the Kotlin repository, in the branch `rekot`: https://github.com/darthorimar/kotlin/tree/rekot.

To start developing/building ReKot:

1. Clone the Kotlin on the branch `rekot` repository from https://github.com/darthorimar/kotlin/tree/rekot.
2. Run `./gradlew installIdeArtifacts -Ppublish.ide.plugin.dependencies=true` in the cloned repository. This will install the Analysis API to your Maven Local.
3. Now you can start working in the ReKot repository, and it can be imported into IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Gradle tasks:
    - `:app:buildProd` - This will create a release (a shadow jar) in `app/build/libs/rekot-VERSION.jar`.
    - `:app:run` - Run the app in the Swing-based terminal emulator, which sometimes can look quite blurry, but it's useful for debugging.
